	* src/etl_proxy/graph/route.clj: Deep first search of route in the
	graph.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph/crud.clj: Old implementation of crud circle
	for graph.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: This file now is a simple name space
	conjunction.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: Rename node into vertex and arc into
	edge.

2012-09-12  Malyshev Artem  <proofit404@gmail.com>

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: Route operation section was added.
	Clean up graph from self-loops and obvious arcs now possible.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: Rewrite update section for generic
	`list-add-action' function.

	* src/etl_proxy/json.clj: Simplify functions will work in
	recursive manner. Attempt in the `grow-sub-tree' logic - it's
	critical point in module.

	* src/etl_proxy/json.clj: Create processing principle. Deploing
	programm structure.

2012-09-06  Malyshev Artem  <proofit404@gmail.com>

	* src/etl_proxy/json.clj: New module for creating graph structure
	from json message.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: I begin to use marginalia literate
	programming system. All module structures was rewritten in
	marginalia markup style.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: At that great point we begin use sets
	instead of lists in graph representation. Many functions in the
	create and read sections has been created. Function in the update
	section has been refactored for correct node addition. If you will
	try to add node which already exist in current graph of to add
	arcs between nonexistent nodes, then resultant graph doesn't
	change at all.

	* src/etl_proxy/graph.clj: Remove unnecessary functions for find
	relation objects with body, use `node-by-id' instead. Add
	`delete-sub-tree' function wich can work only with list of
	roots. Add `delete-nodes-list' for package nodes processing.

	* project.clj: Project initialization.
