	* src/etl_proxy/json.clj: New module for creating graph structure
	from json message.

	* src/etl_proxy/graphs.clj: I begin to use marginalia literate

	marginalia markup style.

	* src/etl_proxy/graphs.clj: At that great point we begin use sets
	instead of lists in graph representation. Many functions in the
	create and read sections has been created. Function in the update
	section has been refactored for correct node addition. If you will
	try to add node which already exist in current graph of to add
	arcs between nonexistent nodes, then resultant graph doesn't
	change at all.

	* src/etl_proxy/graphs.clj: Remove unnecessary functions for find
	relation objects with body, use `node-by-id' instead. Add
	`delete-sub-tree' function wich can work only with list of
	roots. Add `delete-nodes-list' for package nodes processing.

	* project.clj: Project initialization.
