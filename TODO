ETL-PROXY TODO ITEMS                                        -*- mode: org -*-

* Information transformation
** Graph module
*** CRUD
**** Denied direct access to the graph data structure
     We haven't access to graph data structure except declared functions. Clear all [vertices edges]
     pattern matching. Check all other modules for this.
**** Write module tests
     Get tree structure from route test.
**** Document module in the story manner
*** Transform module
**** Transformation mechanism
     Define multimethod based approach for recursive graph transformation.
     Get base principle from json module.
**** Graph equality function
** JSON module
*** Parser
    Rewrite module in transformation multimethods manner.
*** Generator
    Create module with complex opposite functionality to the module above.

* Service configuration
** Emacs-like single dot file configuration
   .etlrc or something like this.
*** Hooks system
*** Multimethods functionality extension

* Session management
  Session manager is a system core. We will follow simple principle:
  - Accept network message
  - Do MongoDB transaction as "ADD TASK"
  - Process all tasks in graph processing module as separate thread
  - Do MongoDB transaction as "TASK RESULT"
  - Send result to the client
  - Clear finished tasks
** Task scheduler
   Look for tasks in the storage and process it with optimal load.
** Connection manager
   Insert task into storage when message come to server.
   Current connection thread becoming to sleep.
   Look for finished tasks and send result to client.
   Close session after success result sending.
** MongoDB based session save session store
   Build in scheduler for clear closed session.
** Http(s) based network transport level

* Destination graphic debugger with graph visualisation system
  Possibility of connection to the existing session by session ID and debug it through nREPL functionality is the
  main aim of this client.

* README file
** Draw Ergo-Proxy anime stile title art
